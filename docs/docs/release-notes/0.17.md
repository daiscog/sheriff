## Version 0.17

The algorithm for dependency rules has been updated, which may introduce breaking changes.

When a module attempts to access another module, the following steps are executed to determine if the access is allowed:

- Sheriff retrieves the tags for both modules.
- For each tag in the "from" module, Sheriff checks if it has clearance to access the corresponding tag in the "to" module.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
  [*] --> RequestAccessToModule
  RequestAccessToModule --> GetFromAndToTags
  GetFromAndToTags --> IterateOverFromTags
  IterateOverFromTags --> HasFromTagAccessToAnyToTag
  HasFromTagAccessToAnyToTag --> AccessDenied: No
  HasFromTagAccessToAnyToTag --> MoreFromTagsAvailable: Yes
  MoreFromTagsAvailable --> AccessGranted: No
  MoreFromTagsAvailable --> IterateOverFromTags: Yes
  AccessGranted --> [*]
  AccessDenied --> [*]
```

For more information, see the [dependency rules documentation](../dependency-rules).
